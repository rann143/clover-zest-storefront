# Shopping Cart: Ecommerce Store Frontend

Live Version: https://cloverzest.netlify.app/home

This application is built using React and FakeStore API. The purpose of this project is to showcase my React skills and working with APIs. 

It functions as an ecommerce store front where you can explore the store, get details about each product, add products to your cart, and automated total cost calculations with a placeholder checkout functionality
