# Clover Zest Design
## A storefront mock up for my Etsy Shop: Clover Zest Design

Live Version: https://cloverzest.netlify.app/home

This application is built using React and FakeStore API. The purpose of this project was to build out a potential frontend for my Etsy shop using React. 

It functions as an ecommerce store front where you can explore the store, get details about each product, add products to your cart, and automated total cost calculations with a placeholder checkout functionality
